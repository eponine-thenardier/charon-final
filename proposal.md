# Charon

Created by Nicole Santiago

## üöÄ Mission statement

Charon is an app for travelers. For a small fee, take a journey down the River Styx to your next destination. Perfect for those looking to live that hedonist lifestyle.

## API & React Router

This application will use the Google Places API and the OpenWeatherMap API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints I intend to use.


- Link to API documentation: [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service), [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3)
- [API endpoint #1](https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location=${lat},${lon}&radius=1500&type=tourist_attraction)
  - Gives us a tourist attraction based on the inputted location.
  - Name, Location
- [API endpoint #2](api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/onecall?)
  - Gives us a description of the weather of a specific location.
  - Overview, Date

Both APIs require a key.



## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

* On the `/home` page, users can choose the place and dates they want to travel.
* On the`/destination` page, users can choose whether they want to see attractions, the weather, or go back home.
* On the `/attractions` page, users can see attractions in their selected area.
* On the `/weather` page, users can see the weather in their selected location during that time of year.
* On the `/notfound` page, users will see an error if their page cannot be found.


## ü§î Stretch User Stories

If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:

* Find hotels in the area
